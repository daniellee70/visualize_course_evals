# Visualizing-course-evals

While putting together my application for promotion to full professor, I thought why not visualize the progress I have made over the years in my teaching. Hence, I started writing this code. I tried to write the code in a way that is as general as possible so that the same code can be used regardless of the course or the year for which the course was taught. Note that the survey format at Plymouth State University has evolved over the years: for example, the survey format of 2018 is not entirely identical to that of 2014, including the survey questions.
